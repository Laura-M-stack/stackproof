# StackProof

StackProof is a full-stack Web3 demo project that showcases the integration between smart contracts and a modern frontend.

The project is structured as a simple monorepo:

## 📁 Project Structure

```
stackproof/
├── stackproof-basic # Smart contracts (Hardhat)
├── stackproof-dapp # Frontend DApp
```

## 🔗 stackproof-basic
Smart contract project built with **Hardhat**.

- Solidity smart contract
- Local blockchain for development
- Deployment scripts

**Tech stack**
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Ethers.js

## 🌐 stackproof-dapp
Frontend decentralized application that interacts with the smart contract.

- Connects to MetaMask
- Reads contract state
- Writes transactions to the blockchain

**Tech stack**
- React
- Vite
- Ethers.js
- Web3 wallet integration

## 🚀 Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Full-stack Web3 development
- Smart contract deployment
- Frontend ↔ blockchain interaction
- Clean project structure and developer workflow

## 🧪 Local Development
Each folder contains its own setup instructions.
